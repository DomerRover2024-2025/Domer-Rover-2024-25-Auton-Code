TODO updated as of 1/20:

TODO:
- create scheduler
- create message manager on rover side
- create weighted round robin
- figure out opcode documentation / where everything must go
- figure out all the metadata that should be associated with a given message.
    - more annoying than it seems; do I need an opcode vs destination?
